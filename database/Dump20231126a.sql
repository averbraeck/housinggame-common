Every areas has some taxes to pay according to the people living there. Check your budget and expectations overview to know what you must pay every round. Look at the map to start thinking about where you would prefer to live.','Before we start, let me introduce you to the area we will be playing in. As you can see on the table, we have three communities on the map. We have a dark green, nature-filled area that is protected from the river with a nature-based solution. This means that there is less space for houses. We have an urban area, a cityscape, which is protected from the river by an artificial dike. Lastly, we have a farmland area directly connected to the river. Each of these areas provides a certain amount of protection against river and rain flooding. You will represent a household living in one of these three areas. Which one that is, is up to you. In a little moment, you will be able to purchase your house. The goal of the game is to increase your satisfaction as much as possible. The house you choose influences your satisfaction. If you don\'t manage to buy your dream house right away, you will be allowed to move in the following rounds. We hope you can find and buy your dream house, keep your feet dry and have some money left to increase your satisfaction and pay off your house. I will now explain the rules of the game.',0,3),(15,'2: House discounts','Floods result in house discounts: When an area was flooded, houses decrease in value: 10k in year 1, 5k in year 2, and 2k in year 3.\r\n','Unfortunately, we see floods happen more often. The world is preparing itself for the water to come. We see the sea level rising every year which means that in the future it could overtop the dikes and riverbanks that keep our feet dry.\r\n\r\nWhen an area is flooded it not only can cause problems when the water is there, but also afterwards. Repairs are needed if houses are damaged, but also potential buyers are discouraged from buying any homes in the area. This means that the house value of a house decreases, resulting in less profit if the house is sold.\r\n\r\nWe do see, however, that in a couple of years, the financial impact of a flood on house value decreases and disappears eventually. \r\n\r\n(Explain house discount rules)\r\n\r\n\r\n',0,3),(16,'3: More rain','More rain on the way: More heavy rainfall over the next years will result in flooding of nature-based solutions. Protection for rain floods in Natucity decrease by 2, and for river floods by 1.','In 2021, in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries, a devastating flood happened in Limburg. In that year, we had a record amount of rain, and the amount of short heavy rains increased. In urban areas, the ground has more difficulty soaking up all this rain, resulting in flooded basements and parks turning into swamps. Nature-based solutions and more green areas such as farmlands in the neighbourhoods can help. But can it help enough? More and more people are looking into ways to keep the water outside their homes or to create better-protected homes against water that does enter.\r\n\r\n<b>Now, the protection level for Rain floods by nature-based solutions, dikes and farmlands decreases by 2 and the protection level for River floods by nature-based solutions, dikes and farmlands decrease by 1.</b>\r\n\r\n',0,3),(17,'4: Taxes increase','Taxes increase in nature-based solution areas: Over the last years demand in nature-based solution areas has skyrocketed, therefore all taxes in Natucity increase with 5k/year.','Areas that are protected by nature-based solutions are known to enhance water quality, reduce air pollution, and conserve natural habitats. This, in turn, results in human well-being and biodiversity benefits. However, due to the increasing demand in such areas, citizenship increases. As a result, such areas are forced to increase taxes in order to maintain the area.\r\n\r\nFrom this round, the taxes of the nature-based solution area for each household number increases with 5k per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n',0,3),(18,'5: NbS','The beauty of nature-based solutions: Nature-based solutions can offer more than protection against floodings. Therefore you receive a one-time bonus satisfaction of 2 points if you live in Natucity, and you gain 1 satisfaction point in you move there (instead of losing 1 point for moving).','As you might have seen, one of the public measures is presented as a nature-based solution. These solutions make use of, well, nature. It often gives the river space to expand when needed. This means that whenever the river doesn\'t need it, these spaces can be used by farmers to let their cattle grace, or by people to walk, sport and relax around in. Just make sure you get out of the nature-based solution area when the river level rises. But at that point, it\'s good to stay inside anyway.\r\n\r\nBecause of the multifunctional aspect of nature-based solutions, an increasing amount of people enjoy living around these solutions. If you live around the nature-based solution area, you can increase your satisfaction score by 2. If a new household relocates to the nature-based solution area it will also gain 2 satisfaction points. (Thus, relocating to this area means they gain 1 satisfaction, normally relocating costs 1 satisfaction).\r\n\r\n',0,3),(19,'0: General Introduction','Welcome to Where we Move, a serious game that analyses the choices made by participants.

Repairs are needed if houses are damaged, but also potential buyers are discouraged from buying any homes in the area.

In that year, we had a record amount of rain, and the amount of short heavy rains increased. In urban areas, the ground has more difficulty soaking up all this rain, resulting in flooded basements and parks turning into swamps.

If the house of a household is not protected and the area is flooded, the house will take damage and the household will lose satisfaction. Households can protect against two types of flooding: River and Rain flooding. Rain flooding happens when rain falls down in large quantities for a long period of time. This causes strain on the sewage system and results in damage. River flooding happens when a lot of excess water from neighbouring countries is brought back to our country and causes the riverbanks to be overtopped. A river overtopping has a large impact, larger than rain flooding. Streets can become rivers and gardens can become temporary pools. To see how much each private measure protects against the two types of flooding, households can look at the overview made by the government.
